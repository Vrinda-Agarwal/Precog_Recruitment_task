# PreCog Recruitment Task
The PreCog Recruitment Task  is divided into Two parts- namely Court Cases Analysis & Classification followed by the Bonus Task(Brownie Points).

For the Court Case Analysis Task I first tried using Google Colaboratory.Later,I found Kaggle workspace more user-friendly.Therefore I have mostly worked on Kaggle.
Jupyter Notebook is an excellent web-based interacting platform for a large memory space.
